**Today's Progress**: Handled UITable view when data is empty. Tried using tableview.backgroundview but ended up using a UIView as the background and setting its visibility as needed. 
Had issues after removing pod files from my git repository (error with RealmSwift), solved it by deleting the project derived files in xcode directory.

**learnt about** 
- Tableview backgroundview 
- Updating a FORKED project with upstream code.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to start commiting to coding again.
