R1-Day 1: September 5, Wednesday, 2018
</h2>   

**Today's Progress**: Handled UITable view when data is empty. Tried using tableview.backgroundview but ended up using a UIView as the background and setting its visibility as needed. 
Had issues after removing pod files from my git repository (error with RealmSwift), solved it by deleting the project derived files in xcode directory.

**learnt about** 
- Tableview backgroundview 
- Updating a FORKED project with upstream code.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to start commiting to coding again.

R1-Day 2: September 6, Thursday, 2018
</h2>   

**Today's Progress**: Added logic to handle location service scenarios such as when it is enabled or disabled, or when location service is denied for the app. Got it to work at first but introduced some bugs, and was also having issues with UIlabel wrapping in auto layout  

**learnt about** 
- Openinging Appplication preferences : setting from within the app

R1-Day 3: September 7, Friday, 2018
</h2>   

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the bug i introduced yesterday by separating the block of code and nesting the location enabled logic and location access granted logic. Don't know if this is the best way yet, but got it to work. Also handled network connectivity (this was too long and not striaght forward compared to android, would hopefuly get a better method as time goes on)

**learnt about** 
- Auto indenting code in xcode using control + I
- Supposedly how to check for network reachability (didnt go deeper)

**Thoughts:** Was almost lost wihin the code, Not that the code is not well formatted. Then checking for network reachabilty was to me cumbersom in IOS.

**Today's Progress**: Worked on opening weather details using segue from another viewController, Added new views to the storyboard and fixed the bug occured when navigating back from weather details viewController. 


**learnt about** 
- Methods of passing data between viewControllers (using instance property, delegation pattern, instance function, NotificationCenter(broadcast in android :-)), closure ) https://learnappmaking.com/pass-data-between-view-controllers-swift-how-to/

**Today's Progress**: Closed out issue with deleting stale data which delete valid date data too when user is offline for days, instead deleting just the old ones. Which close out another issue. Next i would love to

- Date components.

**Thoughts:** Couldn't test the app on my device because i back dated the phone which cause debug profile to fail and somehow couldnt do it on emulator too : this is kinda crazy though.
