R1-Day 1: September 5, Wednesday, 2018
</h2>   

**Today's Progress**: Handled UITable view when data is empty. Tried using tableview.backgroundview but ended up using a UIView as the background and setting its visibility as needed. 
Had issues after removing pod files from my git repository (error with RealmSwift), solved it by deleting the project derived files in xcode directory.

**learnt about** 
- Tableview backgroundview 
- Updating a FORKED project with upstream code.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to start commiting to coding again.

R1-Day 2: September 6, Thursday, 2018
</h2>   

**Today's Progress**: Added logic to handle location service scenarios such as when it is enabled or disabled, or when location service is denied for the app. Got it to work at first but introduced some bugs, and was also having issues with UIlabel wrapping in auto layout  

**learnt about** 
- Openinging Appplication preferences : setting from within the app

**Thoughts:** Was frustrated today though cause of unexpected bugs.

R1-Day 3: September 7, Friday, 2018
</h2>   

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the bug i introduced yesterday by separating the block of code and nesting the location enabled logic and location access granted logic. Don't know if this is the best way yet, but got it to work. Also handled network connectivity (this was too long and not striaght forward compared to android, would hopefuly get a better method as time goes on)

**learnt about** 
- Auto indenting code in xcode using control + I
- Supposedly how to check for network reachability (didnt go deeper)

**Thoughts:** Was almost lost wihin the code, Not that the code is not well formatted. Then checking for network reachabilty was to me cumbersom in IOS.

R1-Day 4: September 8, Saturday, 2018
</h2>   

**Today's Progress**: Worked on opening weather details using segue from another viewController, Added new views to the storyboard and fixed the bug occured when navigating back from weather details viewController. 


**learnt about** 
- Methods of passing data between viewControllers (using instance property, delegation pattern, instance function, NotificationCenter(broadcast in android :-)), closure ) https://learnappmaking.com/pass-data-between-view-controllers-swift-how-to/

**Thoughts:** Felt like i didn't do much today, but closed out a github issue today though. I am also supposed to learn aboout passing data accross viewControllers

R1-Day 5: September 9, Sunday, 2018
</h2>   

**Today's Progress**: Closed out an issue where the local repository cannot fetch data by location. Added migration to realm database. Saved users last known location using Userdefaults (kinda like sharedprefernces in android) and updated the realm query to filter by last used location.


**learnt about** 
- Revisted using UserDefaults and Realm query and Migration

**Thoughts:** Same as yesterday, Need to set higher goals.

R1-Day 7: September 12, Wednesday, 2018
</h2>   

**Today's Progress**: Closed out issue with deleting stale data which delete valid date data too when user is offline for days, instead deleting just the old ones. Which close out another issue. Next i would love to 
 [ ] refactor the code by moving the logic to the view model
 [ ] convert location to using lat and long


**learnt about** 
- Date compasrism
- Date components.

**Thoughts:** Couldn't test the app on my device because i back dated the phone which cause debug profile to fail and somehow couldnt do it on emulator too : this is kinda crazy though.

**Today's Progress**: Just battled with adding a new plugin to podFile in this case i added cocoapd-keys plugin to handle secrete keys in other not to commit them to VCS. 

**learnt about** 
- CocoaPod plugins
- Ways of saving api keys.

**Today's Progress**: Did further work in setting up build configurations using Configuration setting files instead of cocoa-pod keys (good to have knowledge of both though). Did a set up for Release, development and debug configs. Should be setting up AppCenter for build automation on github.

**learnt about** 
- How to use Configuration setting files from [HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/a-cleaner-way-to-organize-your-ios-debug-development-and-release-distributions-6b5eb6a48356)

**Thoughts:**  Enjoyed today, :-) maybe because i leant something new or that i think is new.
