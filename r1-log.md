**Today's Progress**: Handled UITable view when data is empty. Tried using tableview.backgroundview but ended up using a UIView as the background and setting its visibility as needed. 
Had issues after removing pod files from my git repository (error with RealmSwift), solved it by deleting the project derived files in xcode directory.

**learnt about** 
- Tableview backgroundview 
- Updating a FORKED project with upstream code.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to start commiting to coding again.

</h2>   

**Today's Progress**: Added logic to handle location service scenarios such as when it is enabled or disabled, or when location service is denied for the app. Got it to work at first but introduced some bugs, and was also having issues with UIlabel wrapping in auto layout  

**learnt about** 
- Opening=ing Appplication preferences : setting from within the app

**Thoughts:** Was frustrated today though cause of unexpected bugs.
