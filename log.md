I got thinking :thinking:  on how to go about it, then luckily i had little backup on my PC, so i turned my PC off, picked up a pen and a sheet of paper and broke the task down into steps, turned out to be easy and faster.


**Thoughts:** Though i knew jumping onto keyboard when you have a task at hand is not always the right thing to do, but i have always broke that rule. But on a long run it pays more.
