I got thinking :thinking:  on how to go about it, then luckily i had little backup on my PC, so i turned my PC off, picked up a pen and a sheet of paper and broke the task down into steps, turned out to be easy and faster.


**Thoughts:** Though i knew jumping onto keyboard when you have a task at hand is not always the right thing to do, but i have always broke that rule. But on a long run it pays more.

</div>

**learnt about** 
- Object
- Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty()
- Object.keys()


**Thoughts:** This was a liitle bit tricky, though i got the algorithm right on paper (or thought i already did :smile:), The algorithm worked differenlty than i expected..

<div>

</div>

**learnt about** 
- Array.prototype.splice();
- Array.prototype.split()
- Array.prototype.join()


**Thoughts:** Hmm.. :thinking: today, search and replace was simple, but the making sure the case are the same made me spend more time. In the end it is about your analytical thinking.
